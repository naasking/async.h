/*
 *
 * This example shows how to implement a simple code lock. The code
 * lock waits for key presses from a numeric keyboard and if the
 * correct code is entered, the lock is unlocked. There is a maximum
 * time of one second between each key press, and after the correct
 * code has been entered, no more keys must be pressed for 0.5 seconds
 * before the lock is opened.
 *
 * This is an example that shows two things:
 * - how to implement a code lock key input mechanism, and
 * - how to implement a sequential timed routine.
 *
 * The program consists of two async functions, one that implements the
 * code lock reader and one that implements simulated keyboard input.
